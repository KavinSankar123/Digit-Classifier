# Digit-Classifier


## About
- A simple neural network that can classify handwritten digits
- Uses the MNIST dataset for the training and test data
- This neural network was made from scratch using only Python & Numpy
- Can classify handwritten digits with 96.7% accuracy

## Purpose
- To familiarize myself with neural networks
- To apply concepts that I learned through this project
- To understand the underlying concepts/implementations that libraries like Tensorflow or Pytorch might abstract away
